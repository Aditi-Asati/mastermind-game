# Mastermind Game

Two players play this game where Player 1 is the computer and you are Player 2. There are three levels of the game and you are required to select the level that you wanna play the game in.

**Level 1** - You have to guess a 4-digit number in 5 attempts.

**Level 2**- You have to guess a 5-digit number in 8 attempts.

**Level 3**- You have to guess a 6-digit number in 11 attempts.

## Description of the game:

1. Computer (Player 1) will randomly set a multi-digit number (according to the level you have selected) and you have to guess the number in the given number of attempts.
2. If you succeed in your first attempt (*despite odds which are highly unlikely*) you win the game and are crowned Mastermind! 
3. If not, then Player 1 (Computer) hints by revealing which digits or numbers you got correct. 
4. If you happen to guess the right number before the number of attempts gets over, you become a Mastermind, otherwise you lose!
